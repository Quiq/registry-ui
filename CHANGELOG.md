## Changelog

## 0.10.3 (2024-08-15)

* Add `registry.insecure` option to the config (alternatively REGISTRY_INSECURE env var) to support non-https registries.
  Thanks to @KanagawaNezumi
* Fix concurrent map iteration and write in rare cases.
* Upgrade go version to 1.22.6 and all dependencies, alpine to 3.20.
* IPv6 addresses were not displayed correctly.
  In case you need to store registry events with IPv6 addresses in MySQL, you need to run `ALTER TABLE events MODIFY column ip varchar(45) NULL`.
  For sqlite, you can start a new db file or migrate events manually as it doesn't support ALTER.

## 0.10.2 (2024-05-31)

* Fix repo tag count when a repo name is a prefix for another repo name(s)
* Allow to override any config option via environment variables using SECTION_KEY_NAME syntax, e.g.
  LISTEN_ADDR, PERFORMANCE_TAGS_COUNT_REFRESH_INTERVAL, REGISTRY_HOSTNAME etc.

## 0.10.1 (2024-04-19)

* Rename cmd flag `-purge-from-repos` to `-purge-include-repos` to purge tags only for the specified repositories.
* Add a new cmd flag `-purge-exclude-repos` to skip the specified repositories from the tag purging.
* Make image column clickable in Event Log.

### 0.10.0 (2024-04-16)

**JUST BREAKING CHANGES**

* We have made a full rewrite. Over 6 years many things have been changed.
* Renamed github/dockerhub repo from docker-registry-ui -> registry-ui
* Switched from doing raw http calls to `github.com/google/go-containerregistry`
* URLs and links are now matching the image references, no more "library" or other weird URL parts.
* No namespace or only 2-level deep concept
* An arbitrary repository levels are supported
* It is even possible to list both sub-repos and tags within the same repo path if you have those
* Added support for OCI images, so now both Docker + OCI are supported
* Proper support of Image Index (Index Manifest)
* Display full information available about Image or Image Index
* Sub-images (multi-platform ones) are linked under Image Index
* Changed format of config.yml but the same concept is preserved
* Event listener path has been changed from /api/events to /event-receiver and you may need to update your registry config
* Removed built-in cron scheduler for purging tags, please use the normal cron :)
* Now you can tune the refresh of catalog and separately refresh of tag counting, disable them etc.
* Everything has been made better! :)

### 0.9.7 (2024-02-21)

* Fix timezone support: now when running a container with `TZ` env var, e.g. "-e TZ=America/Los_Angeles", it will be reflected everywhere on UI.
* Amend tag info page: add long line break, better format a caption column.
* Upgrade Go version to 1.22, alpine to 3.19 and other dependencies.

### 0.9.6 (2023-03-30)

* Upgrade Go version to 1.20.2, alpine to 3.17 and other dependencies.

### 0.9.5 (2022-09-05)

* Upgrade Go version to 1.19.0, alpine to 3.16 and other dependencies.
* Add an option `anyone_can_view_events` to restrict access to the event log. Set it to `true` to make event log accessible to anyone (to restore the previous behaviour), otherwise the default `false` will hide it and only admins can view it (thanks to @ribbybibby).
* Add an option `purge_tags_keep_regexp` to preserve tags based on regexp (thanks to @dmaes).
* Add an option `purge_tags_keep_from_file` to preserve tags for repos listed in the file provided.
* When purging tags sort them by name reversibly when no date available, e.g. for OCI image format (thanks to @dmaes).
* Fix a bug when there was a bit more tags preserved than defined by `purge_tags_keep_count`.

Also see `config.yml` in this repo for the description of new options.

  So now we support the following formats: Manifest v2 schema 1, Manifest v2 schema 2, Manifest List v2 schema 2
  and all their confusing combinations.

* Change logging library, add "-log-level" argument and put most of the logging into DEBUG mode.
